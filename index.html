        <p>My name is Philip Chang. I was born and raised in a small town called Dangriga
            in Belize. Belize is located just south of the Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula,
            and North of Honduras. This strip that is connecting North America and South America
            is also referred to as Central America.
        </p>

        <p>The population in Belize is ~400,000 with my town's population accounting for ~10,000.
            Belize is considered a third world country but with heavy British and American influence
            that shaped the culture of the people. 
        </p>

        <p>Interesting fact about my country is that we are housing the second largest barrier reef
            in the world.
